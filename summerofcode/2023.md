## Ideas

### Jaeger

#### Implement ClickHouse support

- Description: Jaeger (https://jaegertracing.io) is a popular platform for distributed tracing. ClickHouse is a powerful columnar database, utilized in many commercial and some open source monitoring products. Jaeger currently has a community-provided (unofficial) plugin that implements Jaeger storage backend on top of ClickHouse. This project is to build first-class support for ClickHouse in Jaeger as a core functionality.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Design table schema, document trade-offs
  - Implement ClickHouse support as core storage backend
  - Address schema creation problem / tooling
  - Add relevant documentation to the Jaeger website
- Stretch goals:
  - Use Kafka Connector for ClickHouse for bulk inserts
  - Support Monitoring tab in Jaeger directly from ClickHouse
- Recommended Skills: Go, SQL
- Mentor(s): Yuri Shkuro, @yurishkuro
- Expected project size: 350 Hours
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4196

### KubeVela

#### Vela IDE Plugins

- Description: With more and more developers start writing KubeVela (OAM) application YAML file and CUE-based X-Definitions, it is increasingly important to provide some tools to help user make correct configurations. IDE plugin is one way to reach that. We can make VSCode/Jetbrains plugins for formatting and previewing the written applications and KubeVela's X-Definitions. The plugin should be able to sync environment data (including installed X-Definitions) and make dryrun preview for the rendering result of applications intelligently. It can also provide preview capability for the selected clusters when topology policy is written. Live-diff for the current application and remote application configuration is useful as well. In addition to the application, when users write X-Defintinitions based on CUELang, auto validating and previewing for rendering results under mock inputs can also support them.
- Expected outcome: IDE Plugins for KubeVela, or standalone desktop apps
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, NodeJS, KubeVela, CUELang
- Mentor(s): Da Yin @Somefive
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Hard
- Upstream Issues (URL): https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5366

#### Auto-generate the TypeScript and Java languages API SDK

- Description: Some developers have started to integrate KubeVela into the enterprise system. It is getting increasingly important to provide an API SDK to help developers start faster. Java and TypeScript are currently the two most in-demand languages. KubeVela API server follows the Open API schema. It means the Open API generator tools could provide some help.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Commit the high-quality SDK code, include the TypeScript and Java languages.
  - Commit the GitHub action config and tools to auto-generate SDK.
- Recommended Skills: Java, TypeScript, NodeJS, KubeVela, GithubAction
- Mentor(s): QingGuo Zeng @barnettZQG (barnett.zqg AT gmail.com)
- Expected project size: 175h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issues (URL): https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5428

#### Expand multiple database drivers for the API server

- Description: The API server of the KubeVela needs to save the metadata data to the database to obtain more efficient query efficiency and larger storage space. Now we only support MongoDB. Some users don't have the MongoDB infrastructure. Mysql and PostgreSQL drivers are needed by many users. Most users install the KubeVela without the database. When they want to use it for production, the existing data need to migrate to one database. The migration tool is important.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Commit the Mysql driver code.
  - Commit the PostgreSQL driver code.
  - Commit the migrate data tool code.
- Recommended Skills: Go, KubeVela, Mysql, PostgreSQL
- Mentor(s): QingGuo Zeng @barnettZQG (barnett.zqg AT gmail.com)
- Expected project size: 175h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issues (URL): https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5426

#### KubeVela HA Enhancement-Cluster Meta Backup&Restore

- Description: KubeVela can be deployed in a single management cluster.The KubeVela management cluster has a single point of risk. When KubeVela management clusterdisaster occurs, business continuity cannot be guaranteed. In the production environment of enterprise use case(financial industry), KubeVela needs to have higher availability requirements.  Consider these three enhancements to achieve this goal: cluster meta backup & recovery, master redundancy, failover support. Cluster meta backup & recovery is baseline feature for velaha.
- Expected outcomes:
  - implement velero as KubeVela addon to install velero in kubevela cluster.
  - implement `cli> vela ha enable` to enable cluster meta backup with config scheduled(cron).
  - implement `cli> vela ha restore` to restore cluster meta.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, KubeVela, CUELang
- Mentor(s): Jiahang Xu @jefree-cat(jiahang_xu@cmbchina.com), Xiangbo Ma @fourierr(maxiangboo@gmail.com)
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issues (URL): https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5483

### Prometheus

#### Support OpenMetrics `_created` timestamp in Prometheus

- Description: OpenMetrics specifies the text and protobuf format for metrics the application exposes to systems like Prometheus. One aspect of the Open Metrics format is the exposition of the created time for some metrics like [counters](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#counter), [summaries](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#summary) and [histograms](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#histogram). It allows greater accuracy of rates (counter resets and initial value), compatibility with OpenTelemetry data model and more. Currently, Prometheus does not handle "create timestamps". Thus, this project aims to design and implement initial support for created timestamps in Prometheus (within its APIs and database storage). Note that we don't expect a detailed proposal as a part of the application process. We will work on the final design document together. However, initial thoughts and ideas are welcome and will help the selection process. Mentors are in the EMEA and NA time zones.
- Expected outcome: Prometheus when scraping metrics in OpenMetrics format stores the created timestamp for export and querying purposes.
- Recommended Skills: Go, protobuf, Prometheus
- Mentor(s): Bartlomiej Plotka @bwplotka (bwplotka@gmail.com), Daniel Hrabovcak @TheSpiritXIII (thespiritxiii@gmail.com), Max Amin @macxamin (maxamin25@gmail.com)

### WasmEdge

#### Serialization Completion

- Description: WasmEdge is a WebAssembly runtime in both interpreter and ahead-of-time mode. However, WasmEdge only supports the binary format for the input WebAssembly file. To help the text format WebAssembly loader feature in the future, the implementation of serializing a WebAssembly module is necessary. In this mentorship, we hope the mentee should complete the serialization functions already in [the `dev/serialize` branch](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/dev/serialize) of the `WasmEdge` repo.
- Expected outcome: Complete the serialization functions of WebAssembly modules, such as the element segment and data segment encoding. Complete the WebAssembly instructions encoding. Generate the unit test data and pass the unit tests. >80% of code coverage for serialization.
- Recommended Skills: C/C++, WebAssembly
- Mentors: Yi-Ying He @q82419 (yiying at secondstate dot io), Hung-Ying Tai @hydai (hydai at secondstate dot io)
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2262

#### `zlib` Plugin Support

- Description: The zlib is required for compiling and running many existing C / C++ / Rust apps in Wasm. Most noticeably, it is [needed in the Python port to Wasm](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93819). The VMWare Wasm Labs team is using a zlib port from [Singlestore](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/python-wasi) in [their Python Wasm runtime](https://wasmlabs.dev/articles/python-wasm32-wasi/). In WasmEdge, we could support the zlib host functions through our [plugin system](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/plugin.html). This way, any existing zlib apps can be compiled to Wasm and runs inside WasmEdge.
- Expected outcome: Create a new [WasmEdge plugin](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/plugin.html) that exports all public functions in `zlib`. Implement SDK (in C/Rust) that uses the C ABI to generate corresponding headers for the above plugin. Generate the unit tests and pass the unit tests. >80% of code coverage for verification.
- Recommended Skills: C/C++, Rust, WebAssembly
- Mentors: Yi-Ying He @q82419 (yiying at secondstate dot io), Hung-Ying Tai @hydai (hydai at secondstate dot io)
